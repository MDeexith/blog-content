We are pleased to announce that we are conducting a workshop on Kaggle Competetions. Kaggle is the CodeChef For Data Scientist. It offers a no-setup, customisable, Jupyter Notebooks environment. 

Kaggle Competitions are designed to provide challenges for competitors at all different stages of their machine learning careers. As a result, they are very diverse, with a range of broad types.

We are excited to have Mr. Debarshi Chanda as the Speaker for this workshop. He is an IIT-Guwahati Undergrad and is Kaggle Notebooks Grandmaster. He is also an upcoming Applied Data Scientist @ Amazon and is Weights & Biases Dev Expert.

The Workshop is scheduled to be conducted on 18<sup>th</sup> December, 2022 from 05:00 PM onwards via Zoom.
