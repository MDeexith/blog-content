## Artificial Intelligence Reduces a 100,000-Equation Quantum Physics Problem to Only Four Equations [^1]

Using artificial intelligence, Physicists have compressed a daunting quantum problem that until now required 100,000 equations into just four equations. The breakthrough could help scientists better understand the behavior of electrons in materials, which could lead to new technologies. The work is published in the journal Physical Review Letters.

Physicists are studying how electrons behave as they move on a gridlike lattice, an idealization of several important classes of materials. The model enables scientists to learn how electron behavior gives rise to sought-after phases of matter, such as superconductivity. It also serves as a testing ground for new methods before they're unleashed on more complex quantum systems.

The renormalization group is a jumbo-size set of equations that must be solved. Di Sante and his colleagues used a machine learning tool to make the task more manageable. The program's output captured the Hubbard model's physics even with just four equations. It's like a cross between a switchboard operator and evolution.

They are investigating just what the machine learning is actually "learning" about the system. There are exciting possibilities for using the technique in other fields that deal with renormalization groups, such as cosmology and neuroscience.


## Listen to our major Text to Speech upgrades for 64 bit devices. [^2]

If you already use TTS and the Speech Services by Google engine, there is nothing to do â€“ everything will happen behind the scenes as your users will have automatically downloaded the latest update. With this upgrade we will also be changing the default voice in en-US to one that is built using fresher speaker data, which alongside our new stack, results in a drastic improvement. If your users have not selected a system voice, and you rely on system defaults, they will hear a slightly different speaker.

The Speech Services by Google apk is now available for all 64 bit Android devices via the Google Play Store. This means you can now give your users the ability to choose a voice within your app. We've included some sample code to get you started, and it's fairly straightforward to set up.


## Announcing the PyTorch Foundation: A new era for the cutting-edge AI framework [^3]



PyTorch is moving to a new, independent PyTorch Foundation, under the Linux Foundation umbrella. The foundation's mission is to drive adoption of AI tooling by fostering and sustaining an ecosystem of open source projects. It will democratize state-of-the-art tools, libraries, and other components to make these innovations accessible to everyone.

PyTorch was created by a group of Meta AI researchers to fix the tedious, complicated pipeline of the AI field. PyTorch has since grown into the lingua franca of AI research. The framework will continue to be a part of Meta's AI research and engineering work.

PyTorch was built with an open source, community-first philosophy, and that will not change. The PyTorch Foundation will strive to adhere to four principles: remaining open, maintaining neutral branding, staying fair, and forging a strong technical identity. Meta will continue to invest in the framework, and use it as the primary framework for our AI research and production.

## The EU wants to put companies on the hook for harmful AI [^4]

The EU is creating new rules to make it easier to sue AI companies for harm. A bill unveiled this week is likely to become law in a couple of years. Tech companies complain it could have a chilling effect on innovation, but activists say it doesn't go far enough.

The bill would give people and companies the right to sue for damages after being harmed by an AI system. It will add teeth to the EU's AI Act, which is set to become law around the same time.

![Whether or not it succeeds, this new EU legislation will have a ripple effect on how AI is regulated around the world.](EU.webp "Whether or not it succeeds, this new EU legislation will have a ripple effect on how AI is regulated around the world.")

The EU wants to be the global gold standard for AI regulation. Other countries, such as the US, are considering similar regulations. The Federal Trade Commission is considering rules around how companies handle data and build algorithms. It has forced companies that have collected data illegally to delete their algorithms.
