We are pleased to announce that we are conducting a workshop on Unlock the Power of Data: EDA and Automated Techniques. This workshop will help students to get familiar with EDA and automated techniques involved in EDA.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyze the data using visual techniques. It is used to discover trends, patterns, or to check assumptions with the help of statistical summary and graphical representations. 

We are excited to have Mr. Hrishikesh Yadav as the Speaker for this workshop. He is a Kaggle Expert, VCP @ GDSC-TCET & Streamlit Student Ambassador.

The Workshop is scheduled to be conducted on 14<sup>th</sup> April, 2023 from 05:00 PM onwards via Zoom.
