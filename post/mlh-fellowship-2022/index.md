The Club is conducting a webinar on MLH Fellowship. MLH Fellowship is a fully remote, 12-week internship where participants earn a stipend and learn to collaborate on real open source projects with peers and engineers from top companies. During the MLH Fellowship, you'll gain the type of applied experience that employers want to see.

We are thrilled to announce that the Speaker for the webinar is Asjad Khan who is MLH Fellow'22 @ Solana Labs and MLH Prep Fellow in April'22. He was also an Outreachy'21 Intern @ Eclipse Adoptium.

The Webinar is to be conducted on 2nd September, 2022 at 05:00 PM on Zoom.
